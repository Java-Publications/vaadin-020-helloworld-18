# Backend meets Frontend: After Dependency Injection comes the tidying up
Dependency injection can help make applications clearer and components more distinct. That's not necessarily the case on the first try. That's why every Bootstrappen with Dependency Injection also includes tidying up.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
